# ReceiptValidationLambda

This is a SwiftLambda created using the [Swift Lambda Runtime](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/) and [AppStoreReceiptValidation](https://github.com/slashmo/swift-app-store-receipt-validation) to validate a receipt coming in via an API Gateway Request.
